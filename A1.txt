1).The assignment overall took me 18 days to complete, I had started it on the 7th of April and completed it on the 25th of April.
2).The areas of the assignment that I found the most difficult were the Moving Checker stage and the Moving Pattern stage. For the Moving Checker phase.
   It was mainly difficult as I initally did not understand how to implement the code, however once my friend had explained it to me, 
   I was able to complete the MovingChecker class. While for the Moving Pattern class, it was perhaps due to being confused on what kind of pattern to draw 
   and how I would implement it. However this was solved with a simple rectangle within a rectangle pattern (explained in the MovingPattern class).
   The easy parts were the Moving Rectangle, Oval and Gradient class. 
4).The topics in the course that helped me understand the assignment the most were the topics about Inhertiance i.e. superclass - subclass structure.
