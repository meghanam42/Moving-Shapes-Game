# Moving-Shapes-Game

This is a Java application that allows users to play a game. Once the user presses the start button, they can click anywhere within the game window, and the chosen shape (with the chosen colour, outline, falling path, and speed) are shown. The user can change the colour of the shape, its outline and the path that it falls in. The user can also control the speed and stop the application when desired.

This application was created as a part of a University Course.
